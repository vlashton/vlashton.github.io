It happened on a noon excursion<br>
In the newborn state of spring,<br>
I spied a rose behind a willow,<br>
A red rose unforeseen.<p></p>

In the shadows of the willow,<br>
Back behind that ancient tree,<br>
The rose looked dark and dreary,<br>
But still it called to me.<p></p>

I had no need for such a rose,<br>
I reasoned quickly to the rest,<br>
For in the basket at my side<br>
With ten such roses I'd been blest.<p></p>

I would have stayed and ventured closer<br>
Just to see its reddish fires,<br>
Had there not been obstacles --<br>
The crooked thorns and briers.<p></p>

So home again I hastened<br>
For the noon was closing soon,<br>
And my roses needed water --<br>
In a vase t'would nicely do.<p></p>

But as I neared my neighbor called --<br>
&quot;Oh please now, do not flee!<br>
You look as if you could use<br>
Some crumpets and some tea!&quot;<p></p>

So I entered her quaint cottage,<br>
And there among the knicks and knacks,<br>
Stood the rose from 'neath the willow,<br>
Could it be? Yes there it sat.<p></p>

It looked so bright and happy there<br>
Clad in its dark, deep-red array,<br>
While all of mine had faded<br>
And died along the way.<p></p>

So when I journey forth again<br>
Along life's uncertain shore,<br>
I'll search behind each willow tree<br>
For one lone, red rose more.<br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
