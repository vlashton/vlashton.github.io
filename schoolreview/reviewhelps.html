 <p>The following are links to cover sheets that I used for each class this last spring. I made up a booklet for each child with a picture of them on the front, their name and the year. After that I used one of these sheets in front of the classwork I had included for each subject.</p>
 <p>Usually the pages (other than the main cover sheet) have the name of the class at the top, but they were in the header so when I saved the pages as websites so I could show them to you, they disappeared. I pasted one at the top of the math page so you could get an idea. A lot of the pages don't look quite right as web pages. They lost a bit in the translation I'm affraid, but you can get the idea.

 <p>Remember, this is NOT what they are expecting. This goes way beyond that. It is just so you can see what I do, and maybe get some ideas. I recently started adding the pictures of the textbooks at the bottom of the pages. Again, not necessary, but the kids like to remember what the books they used each year looked like, and we have a scanner now, so why not. :)</p>
 <p>Bare minimum requirement. Make a booklet of the examples of paper work they have done in each class area, include list of books, schedule, and field trips. </p>
