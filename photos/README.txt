QUICK START:

1.) Upload all files to your installation directory.
2.) Edit config.php in a text editor.
3.) chmod the 'storage' directory to 777.
4.) The fake album is now set up.
5.) Edit albums.txt using the format "albumfolder:Album Name"
6.) If you have the PHP FTP module installed, go to the "organize"
directory in your web browser for easy album management.
